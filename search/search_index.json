The task Team 102 decided upon was to create a self regulating system to water plants. Our team split this up into 4 subsystems: internal Tank intake, fertilizer distribution, water distribution, and moisture sensing. This indvidual sheet will be focused on the Internal Tank Intake System. The other functions of the project will be included in the overall team report.
