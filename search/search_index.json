The task Team 102 decided upon was to create a self regulating system to water plants. Our team split this up into 4 subsystems: internal Tank intake, fertilizer distribution, water distribution, and moisture sensing. This indvidual sheet will be focused on the Internal Tank Intake System. The other functions of the project will be included in the overall team report. One thing to remember about this project was created for teams in a school based environment to learn simple electronics and practice embedded software development.</li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#my-contribution","title":"My Contribution","text":"<ul> <li> <p>To review the overarching diagram relating to the subsection, please visit the \"Block Diagram\". section of the database.</p> </li> <li> <p>To review the details regarding the components used to construct the subsection, you can review it in the \"Component Selection\". section of the database.</p> </li> <li> <p>To review the details regarding power consumption, please visit the \"Power Budget\". section of the database.</p> </li> <li> <p>To review the details regarding the schematic, please visit the \"schematic\". section of the database.</p> </li> </ul>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/","title":"Individal Block Diagram","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#team-information","title":"Team Information","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Internal Reservoir system - Sensor/Actuator</p> <p>My Segment of the project will be on on the internal resovoir system which will control water intake.
