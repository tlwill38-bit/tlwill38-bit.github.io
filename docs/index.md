## Introduction

* This Individual datasheet is for the  Internal Resovoir subsection of team 102's irrigation project. The pages of this datasheet will show the design process, project criteria, and overall documentation.

### Project Summary

* The goal of the project is to create a system communication between individual subsystems to provide a function that makes the life of a homeowner easier. The task Team 102 decided upon was to create a self regulating system to water plants. Our team split this up into 4 subsystems: internal Tank intake, fertilizer distribution, water distribution, and moisture sensing. This indvidual sheet will be focused on the Internal Tank Intake System. The other functions of the project will be included in the overall [team report](https://embedded-systems-design.github.io/EGR304TeamTemplate/). One thing to remember about this project was created for teams in a school based environment to learn simple electronics and practice embedded software development.
